# Student Grade Management System

**Complexity:** Medium  
**Time Estimate:** 6-7 hours

## Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

1.  Create robust, production-ready Java applications that implement comprehensive exception handling strategies, unit tests with JUnit and Mockito, and follow SOLID principles for maintainability.
2.  Apply Git workflows and branching strategies to collaborate effectively on team projects, managing feature development, code integration, and version history with proper commit practices.
3.  Evaluate code quality by analyzing adherence to clean code principles, assessing test coverage adequacy, and using static analysis tools to identify areas for improvement.
4.  Analyze complex bugs using IDE debugging tools combined with systematic testing approaches to identify root causes and implement appropriate fixes.
5.  Create comprehensive test suites that effectively isolate dependencies through mocking, validate business logic through unit tests, and can be integrated into automated build and CI/CD pipelines.

## New Architecture Requirements

### SOLID Principles Implementation

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* `ReportGenerator`: Only generates reports.
* `FileExporter`: Only handles file operations.
* `GPACalculator`: Only performs GPA calculations.
* `StatisticsCalculator`: Only performs statistical calculations.
* `CSVParser`: Only parses CSV files.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

* Subject hierarchy can be extended with new subject types without modifying existing code.
* Student hierarchy can be extended with new student types.
* Strategy pattern for grade calculation (can add different grading scales).

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

* Any `Student` subclass can be used wherever `Student` is expected.
* Any `Subject` subclass can be used wherever `Subject` is expected.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

* Create focused interfaces: `Searchable`, `Exportable`, `Calculable`.
* Clients only depend on methods they use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

* High-level modules (`BulkImportService`) depend on abstractions (`CSVParser` interface).
* Use dependency injection in service classes.

-----

## Testing & Git Requirements

### Testing Requirements (80%+ Coverage Required)

* **Overall:** 80%+
* **Critical business logic (GPA calculation, statistics):** 95%+
* **Exception handling paths:** 100%
* **Service classes:** 85%+

### Git Workflow Requirements

**Branch Strategy**

* `main`: Production-ready code (protected).
* `develop`: Integration branch.
* `feature/*`: Feature branches (e.g., `feature/export-reports`, `feature/bulk-import`).
* `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches.
* `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes.

**Commit Requirements**

* Minimum 20 meaningful commits.
* Follow conventional commit format:
  ```text
  feat: add GPA calculation feature
  fix: correct median calculation for even count
  test: add unit test for import service
  ```

**Required Git Workflow**

1.  Create feature branch from `develop`.
2.  Implement feature with regular commits.
3.  Write tests for the feature.
4.  Merge `develop` into feature branch (resolve conflicts if any).
5.  Create pull request with description.
6.  Merge to `develop`.
7.  Eventually merge `develop` to `main`.
